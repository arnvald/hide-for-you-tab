# Hide "for you" tab

Some time ago Twitter introduced algo-based feed similar to those known from TikTok or Facebook. Not everyone likes it and not to be tempted to use it I created this small Chrome (Edge/Opera/Brave/Arc) extension to hide it.

The code was almost entirely generated by ChatGPT with some debugging on my side. Thread here: [https://twitter.com/gregorywitek/status/1642538713849757696](https://twitter.com/gregorywitek/status/1642538713849757696)

## How it works

I have no idea how to properly detect the "for you" vs "following" tab as they both lead to the same page (`/home`) and they use some custom classes that will probably change.
Instead the script just hides the 1st tab.

## Reliability

I've noticed it's not always reliable. I use Arc and sometimes it does not hide the tab. But it does it most of the time which is more than enough for me.

## Creation

It took 9 prompts to ChatGPT with GPT-4, a bit of manual debugging and maybe 20 minutes in total to create it.

## License

This code uses permissive [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) provided that code generated by ChatGPT is actually not licensed in any other way.
